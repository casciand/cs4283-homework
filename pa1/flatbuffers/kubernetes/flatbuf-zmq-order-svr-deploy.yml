# This is a declarative approach to describe a Kubernetes based
# deployment for a corresponding service.
#
# See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/ for more details.

apiVersion: apps/v1  # as required by K8s
kind: Deployment         # Our pod is of the deployment type (because it is a long running server)
metadata:
  namespace: v1   # deploy in this namespace
  name: flatbuf-zmq-order-svr-deploy   # some name for this deployment
  labels:
    app: flatbuf-zmq-order-svr-app  # use the same name here that we used in the service declaration as we we need these two to match
spec:                     # This is the specification where we can even put the number of replicas
  replicas: 1             # default is 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flatbuf-zmq-order-svr-app     # we use same matching label
  minReadySeconds: 5  # if anything crashes before 5 secs, the deployment is not
                          # considered as ready and available. Default value is 0
  template:               # Specified info needed to run the pod and what runs in the pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flatbuf-zmq-order-svr-app        # some label to give to this pod (see the matching label above)
    spec:                 # actual specification of the pod
      hostname: flatbuf-zmq-order-svr-host   # we ask for a special host name so it available to other frontends
      containers:
        - name: flatbuf-zmq-order-svr-container   # container name. Not needed/
          image: casciand/flatbuffers # Either from hub.docker (default) or some publicly accessible URL like your github repo or a private registry.  Here, it points to the image that I have in my repo
          ports:            
            - containerPort: 5578  # port on which the container listens on
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent   # The following forces the node to pull the image if not locally available.
          # The following is the command line to run the protobuf-grpc command as a server
          command: ["python3"]
          args: ["orderServer.py"] # arguments
      restartPolicy: Always # this is the default. Basically, if the pod fails, K8s will restart it.
